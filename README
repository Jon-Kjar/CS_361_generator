Welcome to the README file for Benjamin Hutkoff's content generator. Below are instructions and FAQ for running
the program.

BEFORE RUNNING SOFTWARE:
Before running the software, please make sure you have the Wikipedia API installed.
You can install this API by typing, "pip install wikipedia" into your terminal.

Afterwards, make sure that you have a file called input.csv, search.csv and output.csv in the same directory as the
main.py file.

Once you have met all these conditions, go ahead and run the main.py file.

FAQ:

Q: What is an example test input I can use?

A: Primary Keyword: Puppy dog. Secondary Keyword: breeds.

Q: My primary keyword returns an error. How do I fix this?

A: Your keyword is likely not specific enough. Try typing a more specific keyword (or set of keywords) or restarting
the program. An example would be changing "Puppy" to "Puppy dogs" to increase accuracy. Make sure to restart on failed
input.

Q: The search.csv is blank? Why?

A: The search.csv is truncated (deleted) one the file has been scanned.

Q: My CSV is not loading correctly?

A: Make sure to type "PrimaryKeyword,SecondaryKeyword" the comma is an important spacer. If you have recently done a
search, please delete the keywords in the input.csv file. DO NOT DELETE PRIMARY or SECONDARY from the header in the
input.csv file.
